rcoleman-octopress
==================

This Octopress module is currently limited in functionality but will install Ruby 1.9.3 via RBENV, clone Octopress and install gems via bunlder for the Octopress user.

The most basic usage is to just include the octopress class.

`include octopress`

If you'd like to specify your own Octopress repo to clone from, try this.

`
class { 'octopress':  
  source_code => 'git://github.com/yourID/octopress.git',  
}  
`

TODO
====

* `bundle install` isn't handled if the module doesn't manage Ruby
* This module needs rspec-puppet tests
* Decide if the module should wrap around various rake tasks for managing the blog
* Validate user input
* Manage plugins, themes and other content, probably as defined resource types
